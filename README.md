# QJS

A DOM querying library that is extremely small, and also exceedingly arrogant.

## Forward

Is there a need for an alternative to other DOM querying libraries? No. In an age of javascript frameworks that are functional and opinionated, is there really any need for a DOM querying library? I mean, probably not.

But here we are. This library is small, and meant for me. I made it for myself, and I need a place to access it, so here it is. Will it be useful to you? I'm not entirely sure, but hopefully I will complete some documentation for it, and that will get us much further toward adoption by outsiders.

Who needs this library? Anyone who likes to make websites on an old AMP stack, and hates having to compile a website. If you like making websites, but wish you could just make code and upload it, this might be for you.
